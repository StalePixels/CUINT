Custom User-Interface Next Theming
==================================

CUINT is a GUI based custom editor for NextZXOS Custom Themes - allowing you to tailor the look of the NextBASIC editor, and file browser without having to write any code.

Controlled with the Mouse, or Kempston Joystick, CUINT grants the same customisation power as the Colour Theme files included with NextZXOS 2.07 and above without the need to write any code.
